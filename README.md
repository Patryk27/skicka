# skicka.pwy.io:99

Skicka (from Swedish _send_) allows to send files between machines - no
installation required!

Transmitting a file is as easy as piping its data through `curl`:

```
cat your-file.txt | curl --data-binary @- skicka.pwy.io:99
```

... noting down the link returned by that command and running `curl` / `wget` on
the target machine:

```
curl http://skicka.pwy.io:99/foo-bar > your-file.txt

# or

wget http://skicka.pwy.io:99/foo-bar
```

Alternatively, if your target machine doesn't have those tools, but it does have
a web browser, you can pass a file name when uploading it:

```
cat your-file.txt | curl --data-binary @- 'skicka.pwy.io:99?name=your-file.txt'
```

... and then simply open the link returned by that command in your web browser -
it will download the file as a regular attachment.

You can also transfer arbitrary data (including binary):

```
echo 'Hello, World!' | curl --data-binary @- skicka.pwy.io:99
```

## How it works

Skicka is a proxy - when you run `cat | curl`, it doesn't store the file but
rather keeps the TCP connection alive and then forwards it when you download the
file on the target machine.

It's very much like magic-wormhole, just installation-free!

This also means that links generated by Skicka are one-shot - you can't download
the same file twice (unless you run another `cat | curl`, of course).

## Why

Many times I've had to transfer files between non-developer Linux <-> Windows
machines, where installing Python tools was not an easy task, and hence 
zero-installation Skicka.

## Roadmap

- A simple web interface so that it's possible to transmit files without using
  terminal.

## Limits

- 8 GB maximum file size,

- 120 seconds between running `cat | curl` and starting to download the file
  (note that the download itself _can_ take longer, it's just that you must 
  start the downloading in 2 minutes, otherwise the connection will get closed),
  
- My server (in Hetzner) has a monthly 20 TB upload limit, so take that into
  consideration as well.
  
Note that those limits pertain only the public instance at `skicka.pwy.io:99` -
you can change the limits (passed through command-line arguments) if you want to
launch a self-hosted instance.
